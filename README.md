To start, run `npm install` and then `npm start start`

1. Project was created with create react app
2. Used [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/) because I wanted to try it out since I've been hearing good things about it. Other than that, no additional packages used other than whats provided with CRA
3. There wasn't a mention of TypeScript so figured it wasn't necessary
4. Pretty small task so I didn't think comments were too necessary, code should be easy to follow.
5. Errors will result with a popup message. When selecting the error state in the radio group, it will display a pop up. You can also try using the search where it will then also throw another error, that way you will temporary see the loading state.
6. I found the assessment to be pretty straight forward and quick, spent about 90% of the time making it look pretty/being responsive and 10%, its functionality.
